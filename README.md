Modern Stopwatch

I've been consuming tutorials for months and months without building anything, after talking to other devs, the advice from each one of them was all the same "BUILD PROJECTS". Instead of going for the largest project that I may not have finished, I started small with a clean modern stopwatch using vanilla javascript.

During the build, I used flexbox, gradients, arrow functions, conditional statements, intervals, and of course DOM manipulation
